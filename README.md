# how to run the code and any dependency: 
House price prediction using machine learning 

# How to run:
Installed jupyter notebook

# This project is designed to predict house price based on various features using machine learning technique.
## Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. It uses a regression model to estimate house prices.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided Jupyter notebooks)
- Required Python libraries (install via `pip` or `conda`):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - etc. (list all necessary libraries)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibarath/predicting-house-price-using-machine-learning-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Data Preparation:
   - Collect or provide your own dataset of house features and prices.
   - Place your dataset in the `/data` directory or specify the file path in the code.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook to run the data preprocessing script `data_preprocessing.ipynb`. This notebook handles data cleaning, feature engineering, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. Model Training:
   - Train the machine learning model by running `model_training.ipynb`. You can choose and configure different regression models for experimentation.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance by running `model_evaluation.ipynb`. The notebook provides metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

5. Model Deployment (optional):
   - Deploy the trained model for predictions in your desired environment (e.g., web app, API).
